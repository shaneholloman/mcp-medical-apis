# Every Cure Matrix Knowledge Graph Server

This server provides access to the Every Cure Matrix Knowledge Graph, a Neo4j-based knowledge graph
containing biomedical data for drug repurposing research.

## Server Details

-   **Name:** `everycure-matrix-kg-server`
-   **Path:** `/tools/everycure-kg/mcp`
-   **Base URL:** `https://mcp.cloud.curiloo.com/tools/everycure-kg/mcp`
-   **Production URL:** `https://mcp.cloud.curiloo.com/tools/everycure-kg/mcp`

## Database Versions

The server supports multiple database versions. Default is `everycure-v0.13.0` (latest). Available
versions include:

-   `everycure-v0.13.0` (latest)
-   `everycure-v0.12.0`
-   `everycure-v0.11.0`
-   `everycure-v0.10.0`
-   `everycure-0.4.8`
-   And more...

## Important Notes

-   **Read-only access:** This is a readonly connection. Only SELECT/READ queries are allowed. Write
    operations (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE) will fail.
-   **Node IDs:** Nodes are identified by their `id` property (e.g., `"MONDO:0007113"` for diseases,
    `"CHEMBL123"` for drugs).
-   **Biolink Model:** The graph uses Biolink Model node labels and relationship types (e.g.,
    `biolink:Drug`, `biolink:Disease`, `treats`, `associated_with`).

## Example Workflows

### Finding Drugs for a Disease

1. Use `everycure_kg_find_drugs_for_disease` with a disease ID:
    ```json
    {
        "disease_id": "MONDO:0007113",
        "include_indirect": true,
        "exclude_contraindicated": true
    }
    ```

### Exploring a Node's Neighborhood

1. Get neighborhood statistics:

    ```json
    {
        "node_id": "MONDO:0007113",
        "max_hops": 1
    }
    ```

2. Get detailed neighborhood:
    ```json
    {
        "node_id": "MONDO:0007113",
        "node_labels": ["Drug"],
        "relationship_types": ["treats"],
        "max_hops": 1,
        "limit": 50
    }
    ```

### Finding Paths Between Entities

1. First, get supported metapaths:

    ```json
    {}
    ```

2. Then find paths using a metapath:
    ```json
    {
        "source_id": "CHEMBL123",
        "target_id": "MONDO:0007113",
        "metapath_name": "drug_to_disease_via_target"
    }
    ```
