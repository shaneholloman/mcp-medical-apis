playbook_id: target_centric
name: Target-Centric Discovery
description: |
  Start with a specific biological target implicated in disease and find
  all drugs that interact with it. Useful when a target is strongly validated
  but no approved drugs exist for the disease.
starting_point: target
first_principles_framework: |
  Target-Based Drug Discovery:
  Focus on validated targets with strong disease association.
  Then find existing drugs that modulate these targets.
steps:
  - step_id: 1_validate_target_disease_association
    step_type: query
    description: |
      Gather evidence for target-disease association: genetic (GWAS),
      functional (pathway analysis), clinical (biomarker studies)
    tool_suggestions:
      - gwas_search_associations
      - uniprot_get_disease_associations
      - reactome_get_disease_pathways
    criteria:
      require_multiple_evidence_types: true
    outputs:
      - target_validation_evidence
      - association_strength

  - step_id: 2_understand_target_function
    step_type: query
    description: |
      Understand target's role in disease: Is it upregulated/downregulated?
      What pathways does it participate in? What is its normal function?
    tool_suggestions:
      - uniprot_get_protein
      - reactome_query_pathways
      - kegg_find_pathways
    criteria: null
    outputs:
      - target_function
      - pathway_context
      - disease_role

  - step_id: 3_find_all_drugs_for_target
    step_type: query
    description: |
      Find ALL drugs (approved, investigational, withdrawn) that interact
      with this target. Include both agonists and antagonists.
    tool_suggestions:
      - chembl_get_activities_by_target
      - chembl_search_molecules
    criteria:
      include_all_phases: true
      include_both_agonists_antagonists: true
    outputs:
      - all_drugs_for_target
      - drug_target_interactions

  - step_id: 4_evaluate_drug_mechanism_alignment
    step_type: analyze
    description: |
      For each drug, evaluate: Does its mechanism (agonist/antagonist/modulator)
      align with what's needed for the disease? Consider disease pathophysiology.
    tool_suggestions:
      - chembl_get_mechanism
      - chembl_get_activities
    criteria:
      require_mechanism_alignment: true
    outputs:
      - mechanism_alignment_scores
      - therapeutic_hypotheses

  - step_id: 5_check_other_indications
    step_type: query
    description: |
      Check what other diseases these drugs are approved/trialed for.
      Similar diseases may suggest repurposing potential.
    tool_suggestions:
      - chembl_get_molecule
      - ctg_search_studies
    criteria: null
    outputs:
      - other_indications
      - disease_similarity

expected_outputs:
  - target_drug_candidates
  - mechanism_alignment_assessment

convergence_criteria:
  require_target_validation: true
  require_mechanism_alignment: true
