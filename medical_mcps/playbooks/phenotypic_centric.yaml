playbook_id: phenotypic_centric
name: Phenotypic-Centric Discovery
description: |
  Start with a desired phenotypic outcome (e.g., 'reduce neuroinflammation')
  and find drugs that produce that phenotype, regardless of their original indication.
  This is reverse pharmacology - phenotype first, mechanism second.
starting_point: phenotype
first_principles_framework: |
  Phenotypic Drug Discovery / Reverse Pharmacology:
  Focus on WHAT you want to achieve (phenotype), not HOW (mechanism).
  Mechanism can be discovered later. This avoids mechanism bias.
steps:
  - step_id: 1_define_target_phenotype
    step_type: analyze
    description: |
      Define the target phenotype precisely: What biological outcome do you want?
      Be specific: 'reduce Th17 cell differentiation' not just 'immunomodulation'
    tool_suggestions: []
    criteria:
      require_specificity: true
    outputs:
      - target_phenotype
      - phenotype_definition

  - step_id: 2_find_drugs_producing_phenotype
    step_type: query
    description: |
      Search literature and databases for drugs that produce the target phenotype.
      Look beyond primary indications - side effects and secondary mechanisms count.
    tool_suggestions:
      - pubmed_search_articles
      - chembl_search_molecules
    criteria:
      include_side_effects: true
      include_secondary_mechanisms: true
    outputs:
      - phenotype_producing_drugs
      - phenotype_evidence

  - step_id: 3_deconvolute_mechanisms
    step_type: analyze
    description: |
      For each drug producing the phenotype, deconvolute HOW it produces it.
      This is reverse pharmacology - phenotype known, mechanism discovered.
    tool_suggestions:
      - chembl_get_activities
      - chembl_get_mechanism
      - reactome_query_pathways
    criteria: null
    outputs:
      - phenotype_mechanisms
      - mechanism_hypotheses

  - step_id: 4_validate_phenotype_disease_link
    step_type: validate
    description: |
      Validate that achieving this phenotype would benefit the disease.
      Use disease knowledge base and literature.
    tool_suggestions:
      - pubmed_search_articles
      - reactome_get_disease_pathways
    criteria:
      require_disease_phenotype_link: true
    outputs:
      - phenotype_disease_validation

  - phenotypic_drug_candidates
  - phenotype_mechanism_mapping

  require_phenotype_evidence: true
  require_disease_link: true
