playbook_id: disease_centric
name: Disease-Centric Discovery
description: |
  Start with a disease and systematically identify drugs that could address
  its pathophysiology. Focus on understanding disease mechanisms first, then
  finding drugs that modulate those mechanisms.
starting_point: disease
first_principles_framework: |
  Systems Biology / Network Medicine:
  Understand disease as a network of dysregulated pathways, then identify
  intervention points. Focus on root causes, not just symptoms.

  - step_id: 4_find_drugs_targeting_pathways
    step_type: query
    description: |
      Find approved drugs or drugs in trials that target the identified
      pathway components. Consider both direct and indirect pathway modulation.

  - step_id: 5_evaluate_mechanistic_fit
    step_type: analyze
    description: |
      Evaluate how well each drug's mechanism aligns with disease pathophysiology.
      Consider: (1) Does it address root causes or symptoms?
      (2) Does it target validated pathways? (3) Are there contraindications?
