name: Pathway-Centric Discovery
description: |
  Start with a disease-relevant pathway and find drugs that modulate it.
  This approach recognizes that diseases are pathway dysregulations, not
  single-target problems.
starting_point: pathway
first_principles_framework: |
  Network Pharmacology / Systems Pharmacology:
  Diseases arise from pathway dysregulation. Drugs that restore pathway
  homeostasis may be therapeutic, even if they don't target the 'primary' disease gene.
steps:
  - step_id: 1_identify_disease_pathways
    step_type: query
    description: Identify pathways dysregulated in the disease
    tool_suggestions:
      - reactome_get_disease_pathways
      - kegg_get_disease
      - pathwaycommons_search
    criteria: null
    outputs:
      - disease_pathways

  - step_id: 2_prioritize_by_gwas_validation
    step_type: analyze
    description: |
      Prioritize pathways containing GWAS-identified risk genes.
      Genetic validation strengthens pathway importance.
    tool_suggestions:
      - gwas_search_associations
      - reactome_get_pathway_participants
    criteria:
      prioritize_gwas_pathways: true
    outputs:
      - prioritized_pathways
      - gwas_validation_scores

  - step_id: 3_map_pathway_components
    step_type: query
    description: |
      Map all components of prioritized pathways: genes, proteins,
      metabolites, interactions
    tool_suggestions:
      - reactome_get_pathway_participants
      - kegg_get_pathway
      - pathwaycommons_graph
    criteria: null
    outputs:
      - pathway_components
      - pathway_topology

  - step_id: 4_find_drugs_modulating_pathway
    step_type: query
    description: |
      Find drugs that modulate pathway components. Consider:
      (1) Direct pathway component targets, (2) Upstream/downstream modulators,
      (3) Pathway network effects
    tool_suggestions:
      - chembl_get_activities_by_target
      - kegg_get_pathway  # Some pathways list drugs
    criteria:
      include_indirect_modulators: true
    outputs:
      - pathway_modulating_drugs
      - modulation_mechanisms

  - step_id: 5_evaluate_pathway_restoration
    step_type: analyze
    description: |
      Evaluate whether drug restores pathway homeostasis.
      Consider: Does it address the dysregulation? Are there compensatory mechanisms?
    tool_suggestions:
      - pathwaycommons_traverse
      - reactome_query_pathways
    criteria:
      evaluate_pathway_effects: true
    outputs:
      - pathway_restoration_assessment

  - pathway_drug_candidates
  - pathway_modulation_assessment
